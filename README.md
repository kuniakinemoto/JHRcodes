Japanese House of Representatives Election, District and Municipality Codes

To merge municipality-level results of Japanese House of Representatives elections with other municipality-level data (e.g., demographics and local finance statistics), this spreadsheet should be useful. But a problem is that I made this file a long time ago and it only includes informaion up to the 2000 Lower House election. If anyone can update this file, please do so!
